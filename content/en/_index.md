*Hi, I am Pablo Quirós and this is my web page.*

I am a software developer born in Gijón, living in Mexico City. 
[Here](/cv/) you can find my cv. Now I am trying to catch up with all the 
new developments in artificial inteligence and learn as fast as I can. 
I am also very interested in cryptocurrency, specially Bitcoin.

Although am not a talented singer, I have a natural tendency to play any kind of 
musical instrument. [Here](/content/en/musica.md) you can find more info and some 
recordings. I also love reading any kind of book and watching films. 
[Here](/libros/) I elaborate more about my tastes regarding to books and 
[here](/peliculas/) you can find more about my favorite movies.
