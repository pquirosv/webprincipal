I studied piano for five years in Conservatorio de Música de Gijón.
Later I took guitar, bass guitar and drums lessons in Universidad Popular de Roces.
I played in different cover bands, one of them was The Fartones, with
me on the drums and my parent on the bass guitar.

In my years in Madrid I formed the band [Vélez Málaga](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/artist/3kgui2eAFjNoTIsBfLIltM) with three
Andalusian friends, we released two albums: the first one
*[Platos Combinados](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/0x1FGbKGjAFZt0GBNeDnbn)* influenced by soviet post-punk bands like Kino,
and the second one, *[Carmona Izquerdo](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/7ABKyJI0IJRb5eCwWbayb6)* a more festive album 
with songs like [Kebab Vegetal](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/track/2cKqupY8z6R3D8Vjj5Edpn).
